<h1>Sidi Bou Saïd </h1>
<p>Next to the famous city of Carthage and its thermal baths, the charming village of Sidi Bou Saïd stands out for its architecture and its houses colored in blue and white. Stroll through the small cobbled streets of this village and admire the doors of the houses, which are, for the most part, meticulously decorated. You will find in this charming village many hotels and guest houses, which facing the sea will offer their visitors landscapes of rare beauty. On the cultural side, you will take the opportunity to visit a few museums, in particular the Dar el-Annabi museum to discover the art of living in Tunisia and the Dar Nejma Ezzahra palace where musical instruments are exhibited and where concerts and shows also take place. The view is exceptional. To bring back some souvenirs, head to the traditional Art Lella Salha & Des Métiers market where you will find spices, 
traditional handicrafts, clothes, carpets… you will be spoiled for choice.</p>

<h1>Douz, gateway to the Sahara</h1> 
<p>In the south of Tunisia, the oasis of Douz is renowned for being the <b>gateway to the Sahara</b>, 
<br>the starting point for excursions in the desert. Surrounded by sand dunes, the city retains its nomadic traditions and captivates with its warm and atypical atmosphere. 
Take advantage of the setting to treat yourself to an excursion by 4x4, on foot… or by camel.</p>

  <p>Tozeur, the largest of the oases and the most beautiful with its superb palm grove! 
  Take the time to stroll through the narrow streets of the Medina with its brick houses with beautiful patterns and typical studded doors. You will surely observe women there weaving beautiful carpets.
   Located at the gates of the desert, Tozeur will be a good starting point for a camel or 4x4 ride.</p>

<h1>Ksar Ouled Soltane</h1>
<p>Located in Tataouine, the ksar Ouled Soltane built in the 15th century is one of the most beautiful multi-storey attics in the country organized around two large courtyards. With its rounded shapes, its external staircases on the facade and its earth colors, this ksar was used to store the food reserves of one or more tribes. Built on a hill, the site offers beautiful views. Does this site remind you of something? 
You must have seen it in one of the episodes of the Star Wars saga!</p>

<h1>Dougga</h1> 
<p>Dougga is an archaeological site, a hundred kilometers from Tunis, 
in excellent condition and probably one of the best preserved in the whole of the Maghreb. Classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, its remains are located on a hill and extend over more than 25 hectares. It takes half a day to observe most of the buildings such as the theater, the capitol, the thermal baths, several temples and a mausoleum... One thing is certain, if you are in the northern region during your vacation in Tunisia, 
a visit to Dougga is a step not to be missed!</p>
